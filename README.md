# Dashboard-Subsystem-

The low voltage sub-team develops the embedded software that handles the data acquisition system (DAQ) which was developed in-house by the team. Information from the DAQ allows us to monitor the car’s performance and can provide essential information to the driver through the dashboard which can help them take critical decisions while driving. 
I was responsible for: 
•	Collecting Data from DAQ and Dead Reckoning system via CAN communication protocol and displaying all the essential information needed for the driver on the Dashboard (HMI Human-machine interface).
•	Monitoring the data and displaying warning messages and sending all the warning messages to the data logging system via a CAN communication protocol to be stored.
•	Designing the PCB for the dashboard system.
•	Controlling all buttons and switches on the steering wheel.
•	Drawing Live track on the Dashboard.
